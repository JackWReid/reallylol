I like a movie that gets out of hand like this. I'd forgotten until the opening credits that this was Ari Aster. Its marketing doesn't have the trappings of the horror genre because the setting doesn't have those traditional elements either. But this is definitely horrific, and effective. Its ideas are right on its sleeve but it still has interesting enough things to say about them that it works. There's a streak in me, and I see it in others, to find the major questions of our time just aesthetically *lame* and to not want them to appear in my art for that reason. Coronavirus,screens and online radicalisation, fascism, division, all that crap is what I'm talking about. Nobody wanted to see a Covid movie for a long time and the first scene of this movie hits that point hard with a conversation about literal face mask policing.

Anyway, this movie was great and weird and fun and right. The fact it pissed off shallow watchers on left and right makes it feel about right.

Probably helpful to my experience was that we watched this in the biggest screen at Passage, the old theatre with great seats and a solid picture and sound.
