I love cooking but the terminology seems very fluid to me until I hear chefs talking to each other about how they prepare an ingredient in a way that sounds so specific. It turns out these words do have distinct meanings that I struggle to hold in my head.

## Sautéing
A very awkward Frenglish word. Means frying ingredients in not very much oil but over a relatively high heat.

## Searing
A larger ingredient like a meat is cooked over a very high heat just to brown the surface. The process that makes things go brown is called the Maillard reaction. Usually things are seared and then cooked over a lower heat to get the middle.

## Sweating
Sweating involves cooking diced vegetables, like onions, over a low heat in some oil so that they evaporate some of their moisture without browning at all.

## Braising
A combination of wet and dry heat. First the ingredient is sautéed and then transferred to a covered pot with a hot liquid like a stock or gravy.

## Tempering
Cooking herbs and spices in hot oil to get them to release some of their essential oils before being mixed in with the rest of the dish.

## Deglazing
Taking the oil you were cooking food in and running it off to start a sauce by adding stock etc. Probably only applies to meat.

## Coddling
Heating food in water that’s just below boiling point. It’s pretty much only done to eggs now.

## Poaching
Heating food in water that’s about 70-80 degrees celsius.

## Simmering
Heating food in liquids that are above poaching but below boiling temperature, 70-100 degrees celsius.
