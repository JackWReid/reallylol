[This excerpt](https://www.wired.com/story/everything-you-need-to-enjoy-one-tech-free-day-a-week/) from _24/6_ by Tiffany Shlain makes the case for setting aside a day to go tech free: ditching phones and laptops and screens for the day. It's come along just at the right time for me, as I'm generally shrinking away from tech outside of my work life more and more.

I like the way the article describes what you might need a tech-free day: a basic watch, a pen, and a little notebook containing some emergency phone numbers. Slightly idealistically it argues that the day then becomes about the basics: seeing friends, hanging out and chatting, playing games, cooking meals.

I'm going to try it this weekend, my phone left at home in a drawer. I'll see how it goes.
