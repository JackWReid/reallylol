At school I luxuriated in not trying very hard and doing alright anyway. Teachers told me that I was "gifted", a term that was, incredibly, written into education regulations at the time. Teachers told me that I was also lazy, and that I had much more unrealised potential if I would *apply* myself. I think it's a pretty common story. I was not anything special, though.

I'm thirty going on thirty one, almost a decade into a career with which I have a very fraught relationship. I want change and to get it I need to grow. Materially, I need to learn some things: languages, skiills.

Finding out how much learning potential I've lost since those school years has been the theme of this year. What would have snapped into place with very little effort as a schoolkid just isn't taking now as an adult. My work ethic has improved a hundred times over, but my simple ability to learn and think has seemingly degraded even more.

So what, blame a decade of the internet, short-form video, AI? Maybe, but also I suppose I finally accept there's a reason that we go to school as *children*. If I were exercising more, I might find around now that I simply couldn't put on muscle as a twenty year old could. This comes to everyone. It's just, I thought the mental decline started later.

Maybe once I drop this career that (as I've been asserting a lot lately) has done some kind of damage to my head. Or at least, my brain has grown in the wrong ways like those watermelons in cube shapes.

It was probably a bad idea to stage a series of mental tests in the fields of language and skill acquisition just before my thirty-first birthday. The theme of the ticking clock is too much.

> You should stay away from your potential. I mean, that is something you should leave absolutely alone! You’ll mess it up! It’s potential, leave it! And anyway, it’s like your bank balance, you know – you always have much less than you think. Leave it as the locked door within yourself and then at least, in your mind, the interior will always be palatial. Wonderful gleaming marble floors, brocaded drapes. Mullioned windows, covered in mullions, whatever they are. Flamingos serving drinks. Pianos shooting out canapés into the mouths of elegant men and women who are exchanging witticisms… “Oh yes, this reminds me of the time I was in BudaPESHT with Binky… We were trying to steal a goose from the casino, muahahaha…” But it won’t be like that. You don’t want to find out that the most you could possibly achieve, if you gave it your all, if you harvested every screed of energy within you, and devoted yourself to improving yourself, that all you would get to would be maybe eating less cheesy snacks.
