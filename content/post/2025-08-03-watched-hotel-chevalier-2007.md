This really reminds me of being a certain age and experiencing the culture as remixed in Tumblr posts and usernames. It's kind of a series of poses in tableaux. It was made to be clipped, GIFed and posted to Tumblr with "ugh, this." as the caption. Which is to say, I like this short film and it reminds me of a much simpler time that I thought was complicated when I was living it.
