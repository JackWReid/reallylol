p8
>**WG Sebald** was the last German author to make an international breakthrough. He grew up a few miles from the Austrian border, grew up in England, and considered himself a student of **Peter Handke** of the Grazer Gruppe.

> **Wenderoman** authors Monika Muron and Uwe Tellkamp turned to **The New Right**. Later authors of the genre bucked the trend: Lutz Seiler, Jenny Erpenbeck, and Felix Stephan.

p9
>The best West German art came from people who saw the Americans not as liberators but as those who ran a system that allowed the Nazis to integrate into the new government and elite: Gerhard Richter, Jörg Immendorf, Alexander Kluge.

p10
>**Walter Benjamin** observed that across Europe there was once scarcely an interior where no one had died.

p17
>Like **Heiner Müller** says, it is better to speak of *people* than *the people*.

p32
>**Eva Leitolf** spent 20 years assembling the series *Deutsche Bilder*, photos of places where racist attacks have occurred.

p34
>In **Minima Moralia**, Adorno wrote about getting on with cars whilst in exile in Los Angeles.

p80
>(Dische-Becker) It is almost as if there's a monogamous relationship between Germany and Jews, and anyone else is an interloper.

p90
>Germany is *the* arbiter in Europe when it comes to both antisemitism and migration. If Germany says it's fine to drown people in the Mediterranean, then it's fine to drown people in the Mediterranean because the people who are the most sorry for their past treatment of minorities and have learned the most from their abuse of racialised people say it's fine. If Germanys says the people trying to get into Europe are a danger to Jews so it's fine to deny them entry, then it's fine to turn them away.
