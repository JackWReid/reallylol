title: Pubs in London with outdoor heaters
---

I was forwarded a PDF that began life as a Google Doc, before it was overwhelmed by demand. Crowd-sourced, guerrilla resources often spring up like this in times of difficulty. Perhaps I should be less surprised at how quickly Londoners have acted to work out where to get a pint without exposing yourself to the virus or the freezing cold.

PDFs are notoriusly inconvenient to quickly reference, so I'm mirroring here. Text presented as found, below.

I woke up with 1800 emails requesting access. I didn’t really have any dreams of going viral so now this document is locked. Sorry. Happy drinking.
