Yesterday I watched a whole season of Kingdom on Netflix. It's a big budget zombie show set in 16th century Korea. It being a Korean language show, there are English subtitles. However the subtitles not only translate dialogue but describe other sounds. Here is a non-exhaustive list of those subtitles.

- Indistinct shouting
- Munching
- Screaming
- Indistinct chatter
- Sword rasping
- Distant snarling
- Men whimpering
- Chain clanks
- Snarling 
- Screaming continues
- Screaming intensifies
- Sucks teeth
- Amused gasp
- Horse neighs
- Thudding continues
- Men gasp
- Rumbling
