We watched _Bugonia_. Spoilers to follow.

We both suspected that she really was an alien at different points during the movie. 

When Teddy exploded in the wardrobe, I wondered for a moment whether either he'd detonated the vest on purpose in an attempt to kill the aliens on whatever ship he thought he was being teleported to, or she'd somehow triggered the vest to trick him. The latter theory was ruled out by the fact she probably wouldn't have done that in her actual teleportation wardrobe.

I liked the way she popped the world like a little bubble with a weird, spiky thing.

The montage where everybody on earth was dead at the end was sort of cathartic. I suppose that a lot of people feeling doom-brained about reality will feel the same way, and actually it's a little bit of a theme along with _House of Dynamite_. We're just thinking about the end of us all more than usual right now.

The desperation of the antifreeze was tough to watch.
