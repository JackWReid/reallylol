Take these for the pain\
twice daily after eating\
Take these for a headache\
and these for your tired legs\
Take these for a pain in the neck\
in the mornings

Take these if you miss your train\
And you can't see the funny side\
Take these if you suffer

Take these for loss\
or a twinge in the heart\
Take them in the evening\
Stand by a window you can't see out of\
Take with water and look into the dark\
For as long as you can bear

Take these for courage\
Take a partner by the arm\
Take half a pill each

Take these for free\
I don't know what they do\
Try them for a pit in your stomach\
or for you indecision and fear of flying\
As for fear of dying\
Take whisky
