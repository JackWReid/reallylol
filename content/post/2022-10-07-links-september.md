First I have a whole collection of maps. There's a map to show [where in the world Wikipedia edits][1] are coming from. There's a map that shows all the different kinds of [planning boundaries][2] that overlap the in Britain. There's an incredibly [detailed weather map][3]. Finally, here's a whole series of maps that examine how much [various governments fudged][4] their COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality rates.

There are a couple of websites about making websites to share. First is [this fun tool][5] to make scrappy, zine-like websites for party invitations and so on. On the more technical side is a pleasingly from-first-principles [guide to making your own website][6].

I like when you rankle a nerd of a particular flavour enough that they go off on an informative rant. Here is one such example in which a blogger dispels the erroneous factoid that The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest surviving work of fiction. [It is, in fact, not][7].

The only thing tying these last two links together is the innate urge in humans to collect and make taxonomies. In the first case, a blogger shares his love for what he calls "[vernacular photography][8]", that is: snapping up family photos cast away into eBay auctions. The second is a Dirt newsletter edition about [The Cari Institute][9], which creates taxonomies of "micro-aesthetics" such as "Corporate Grunge" and "Festival Marketplace".
