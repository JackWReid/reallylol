Watched as part of a triple-kino weekend in dark, freezing Berlin. This one at Rollberg. Maybe that contributed to our dislike; we always resent walking past Passage and having to climb the hill to the ugly shopping centre.

We both hated the ending. It was visually poorly executed and seemed like a reshoot, sound stagey, VFXey mess. It was also not really earned. Why is she tearing pages out of her notebook? She was never writing! Was it real or a fantasy or a delusion? Who cares.

It's kind of a pity, there were some really great performances from the leads and some tasty peculiarities. When the credits rolled and I saw that it was an adaptation of a novel, it sort of clicked into place. The non-linear structure, the struggle to depict subjective interiority, the uneven sections with Lakeith Stanfield, and that ending. Adaptation is hard.
