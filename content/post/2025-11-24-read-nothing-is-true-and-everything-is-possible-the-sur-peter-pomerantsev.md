I finished reading this book on a plane to Amsterdam and in the end, it felt right to be reading it in aviation-land. It's an airport read. I got what I wanted from it in that it gave a little bit of insight into the Russian media and political landscape of the 00s. I learned some new names and had my memory of others reinforced. That said, there's a bit of self-aggrandising in here and there's not a little bit of misogyny. Maybe that's authentically what a slightly mercenary TV producer in Russia sounds like, though.
