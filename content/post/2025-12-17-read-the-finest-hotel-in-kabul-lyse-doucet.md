Although LyseDoucet's [sic] habit of introducing herself as a background character with a huge wink to the stalls grated a bit after a while, I ended up very endeared to this book in the end. I remember live coverage of the war in Afghanistan on the BBC growing up, and the image of Lyse Doucet on some balcony with explosions in the background is strong in my mind. She's a badass, and this feels like a relatively well executed diversion for her. The debt this owes to _The Grand Budapest Hotel_, or maybe that that movie owes to hotels like this, is clear.
