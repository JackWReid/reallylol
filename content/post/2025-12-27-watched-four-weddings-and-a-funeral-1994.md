I watched this with the in-laws at Christmas as part of a Richard Curtis runthrough. Coming after Notting Hill it was stark how poorly this film has aged in comparison. Perhaps it was never as good in the first place, but Hugh Grant is far more clearly a twat, Kristen Scott Thomas's character is written as a complete moron, and neither of these in the endearing ways that the writer cracks later. Nevertheless, the Auden bit still gets you, but he didn't write that did he.
