I was watching _Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1999)_ the other day. It's the height of camp, and I was trying to work out what the elements were and what they reminded me of. Then it came to the [introductory Potiphar number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SyC04sdbBs) and it clicked.

[_The Rich Man's Frug_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcrZIK3gqbU) is a dance number that appears in _Sweet Charity (1969)_, a musical comedy directed by the choreographer Bob Fosse. It typifies Bob Fosse's style: absurdist elements, people-as-stage, and intense camp. It had to have inspired that Potiphar number, right?

There's one more place it popped up recently: in Rihanna, DJ Khaled, and Bryson Tiller's great [performance of _Wild Thoughts_](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6dwcoj) at the Grammys in 2018. Same bizarre movements, elegant and camp dress, same dept of staging and silhouetting.
