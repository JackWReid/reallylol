I collect interesting things from the web as I go. That collection takes a few forms. Firstly, there's this fixed directory of links that I try to update and prune and organise into sections that feel right. Secondly, I sometimes make posts that round up interesting things I've found in the month or so prior. Finally I have "highlights", where I cut out interesting snippets from longer articles and paste them here.

Scroll down a little for the directory. Scroll down a little further for a paginated list of highlights and link posts.
