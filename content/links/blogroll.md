Here's this fixed directory of links that I try to update and prune and organise into sections that feel right. I also sometimes make posts that round up interesting things I've found in the month or so prior. You can also check out [highlights](/highlight), which are just excerpts from elsewhere that I saved, and posts tagged [links](/tags/links), where I generally round up a bunch of links I found interesting. Finally [saved links](/links/saved) are just things I quickly earmarked online as worth saving.
