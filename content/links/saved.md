There's a compulsion as you spend hours and hours reading things in little screens, to save the things that seem important somehow. You want to squirrel them away and at the same time mark them as significant somehow. It's like you're earmarking them as a source in some great big essay about everything that is always just around the corner and will be reviewed and marked, and that will ultimately secure your passage into the afterlife, or not.

Here are the links I save in the delusion that I'll come back to them someday. In a more orderly fashion, on [the blogroll](/links/blogroll) are links that I treasure in some way.
